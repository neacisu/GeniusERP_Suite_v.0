# Roadmap Triggerra Collaboration Hub (F4-1)

> **Scop:** să implementăm **Triggerra Collaboration Hub** ca modulul responsabil de **Team Collaboration & Project Management** în suita GeniusERP – cu integrare profundă de **workeri AI** (ai.summary, report.kpi, email.send) și interoperabilitate completă cu toate modulele existente (Manufacturing, Accounting, HR) pentru closed-loop collaboration operations.

**Target F4-1:** Kanban Boards + Real-time Chat + OKR Alignment + Team Management + Project Tracking + Activity Feeds.

**Bounded-context Collaboration:** teams, team_members, projects, project_assignments, kanban_boards, kanban_columns, kanban_cards, chat_channels, chat_messages, okr_objectives, okr_key_results, activity_feed, notifications cu automatizare completă pentru team productivity și project success.

**Workers integrati:** 
`ai.summary` (meeting summaries, project progress), `report.kpi` (team productivity KPIs), `email.send` (notifications și digest emails), `pdf.render` (project reports)

## Preconditions

**Prerequisite obligatorii:**
* **Gate F3→F4 PASSED** – Accounting generează balanță din tranzacții Mercantiq; payroll postează jurnal în Accounting  
* **F2-1 Vettify Complete** – CRM system operational cu team structures
* **F3 Complete** – Manufacturing, Accounting, HR operaționale cu Event Bus
* **Worker Fleet** disponibil: `ai.summary`, `report.kpi`, `email.send`, `pdf.render`
* **Event Bus v1** – naming convention `<module>.<context>.<event>` funcțional
* **Database PG17** – multi-tenancy RLS activă cu politici standard
* **Observability Stack** – Prometheus/Grafana/Tempo/Loki operațional

## Events published by Collaboration Hub

* **`collaboration.team.created`**: echipă nouă creată cu membri
* **`collaboration.project.created`**: proiect nou cu team assignment
* **`collaboration.project.completed`**: finalizare proiect cu deliverables
* **`collaboration.kanban.board.created`**: board Kanban nou pentru proiect
* **`collaboration.kanban.card.moved`**: mutare card pe board cu status update
* **`collaboration.kanban.card.completed`**: finalizare task cu rezultate
* **`collaboration.chat.channel.created`**: canal chat nou pentru echipă/proiect
* **`collaboration.chat.message.sent`**: mesaj nou în chat cu context
* **`collaboration.okr.objective.created`**: obiectiv OKR nou cu alignment
* **`collaboration.okr.keyresult.updated`**: actualizare progres key result
* **`collaboration.activity.logged`**: activitate nouă în feed cu details

## Events consumed by Collaboration Hub

* `manufacturing.work_order.completed` - auto-create follow-up tasks în Kanban
* `accounting.period.closed` - trigger financial review objectives în OKR
* `hr.employee.hired` - auto-add to team và create onboarding project
* `hr.performance.evaluated` - update individual OKRs cu performance data
* `sales.deal.won` - celebrate team success și update revenue OKRs
* `procurement.po.approved` - create procurement follow-up tasks

## JSON Implementation Steps

**Range:** 800-899 (100 steps pentru complete Collaboration Hub cu F2 granularity)

**Naming Convention:**
- Workers: `<domain>.<action>` (collaboration.summary, collaboration.kpi)
- Events: `<module>.<context>.<event>` (collaboration.team.created)
- Tables: snake_case cu prefixe (collab_teams, collab_projects, collab_kanban_boards)
