# Task: F7 Continuous Improvement Documentation

## Description

Create comprehensive roadmap documentation for F7 Continuous Improvement phase covering AI Vision, IoT Gateway, and GDPR Portal with next-generation capabilities and future-ready architecture.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Create `Documentation/22_roadmap_ai_vision.md` with 50+ JSON steps  
- [ ] Create `Documentation/23_roadmap_iot_gateway.md` with 60+ JSON steps
- [ ] Create `Documentation/24_roadmap_gdpr_portal.md` with 40+ JSON steps
- [ ] Document AI Vision with image classification and defect detection
- [ ] Specify IoT Gateway with MQTT buffering and edge computing  
- [ ] Detail GDPR Portal with data subject rights and automated compliance
- [ ] Include next-generation AI capabilities and future roadmap
- [ ] Document edge computing integration patterns
- [ ] Follow exact JSON format from F2 roadmaps

## Technical Details

### **AI Vision System**
- **Image Classification**: Real-time product and quality classification
- **Defect Detection**: Automated quality control with computer vision
- **Heat-map Analytics**: Production line performance visualization  
- **Event Patterns**: vision.*, classification.*, quality.*
- **Workers**: ai.vision.classify, ai.vision.defect, ai.vision.analytics
- **Integration**: Shop-floor terminals and quality control workflows

### **IoT Gateway Platform**  
- **MQTT Integration**: Industrial IoT device communication
- **Edge Computing**: Local processing with cloud synchronization
- **Offline Buffering**: Resilient data collection and transmission
- **Device Management**: IoT device provisioning and monitoring
- **Event Patterns**: iot.*, device.*, sensor.*
- **Architecture**: Edge-to-cloud data pipeline with real-time processing

### **GDPR Data Portal**
- **Data Subject Rights**: Export, rectification, erasure self-service
- **Automated Compliance**: Privacy by design implementation
- **Consent Management**: Granular consent tracking and withdrawal
- **Audit Framework**: Complete GDPR compliance monitoring
- **Event Patterns**: gdpr.*, privacy.*, consent.*
- **Workers**: gdpr.export, gdpr.erase, gdpr.audit, gdpr.consent
