# Task: F3 Numeriqo Manufacturing Documentation

## Description

Create comprehensive roadmap documentation for Numeriqo Manufacturing module covering BOM management, MRP II engine, shop-floor terminals, and production scheduling with Romanian manufacturing regulations compliance.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Create `Documentation/12_roadmap_numeriqo_manufacturing.md` with 100+ JSON implementation steps
- [ ] Document BOM (Bill of Materials) management with multi-level structures
- [ ] Specify MRP II engine with demand planning and capacity management
- [ ] Detail shop-floor terminals with real-time production tracking
- [ ] Include Romanian manufacturing regulations and safety standards
- [ ] Document worker integrations: forecast, ai.classify, report.kpi
- [ ] Specify event patterns: manufacturing.*, production.*, quality.*
- [ ] Follow exact JSON format from F2 roadmaps (step, scope, context, task, dirs, constraints, output)

## Technical Details

### **Implementation Approach**
- Follow F2 JSON step format exactly
- Start with step 500 and continue sequentially  
- Use canonical directory paths `/standalone/numeriqo/apps/manufacturing/`
- Integrate with existing Worker Fleet (forecast for demand planning)
- Document observability patterns (Prometheus metrics, Grafana dashboards)

### **Key Components**
- **BOM Management**: Multi-level bill of materials with versioning
- **MRP II Engine**: Material requirements planning with capacity constraints  
- **Shop-Floor Terminals**: Real-time production tracking and feedback
- **Quality Control**: Integration with quality workflows and compliance
- **Production Scheduling**: Advanced scheduling with resource optimization

### **Romanian Manufacturing Context**
- Industrial safety standards and regulations
- Production reporting requirements
- Quality compliance frameworks
- Worker safety documentation requirements

## Dependencies

- [ ] F2 Commercial Core Apps completed (template reference)
- [ ] Worker Fleet specifications from existing documentation
- [ ] Event-Bus v1 conventions established
- [ ] Romanian industrial regulations research
- [ ] Manufacturing domain expertise validation

## Effort Estimate

- **Size**: L (Large)
- **Hours**: 16-20 hours
- **Parallel**: true (independent of other F3 modules)

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Complete roadmap file created (100+ JSON steps)
- [ ] All manufacturing processes documented
- [ ] Worker integrations specified
- [ ] Romanian compliance covered
- [ ] Quality validation against F2 standard
- [ ] Cross-references to related modules verified
- [ ] Event patterns documented
- [ ] Observability patterns included
