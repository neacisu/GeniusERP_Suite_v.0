# Task: F6 Hardening & Multi-Cloud Documentation

## Description

Create comprehensive roadmap documentation for F6 Hardening phase covering multi-cloud disaster recovery, ISO27001 compliance, and mobile React Native suite with enterprise-grade security and reliability specifications.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Create `Documentation/19_roadmap_dr_multi_cloud.md` with 60+ JSON steps
- [ ] Create `Documentation/20_roadmap_iso27001.md` with 40+ JSON steps
- [ ] Create `Documentation/21_roadmap_mobile_suite.md` with 70+ JSON steps
- [ ] Document AKS ↔ EKS failover procedures with RTO < 15 minutes
- [ ] Specify ISO27001 stage 2 audit preparation with control implementation
- [ ] Detail React Native applications with offline parity for Shell, iWMS, Mercantiq
- [ ] Include disaster recovery automation and testing procedures
- [ ] Document security hardening and compliance frameworks
- [ ] Follow exact JSON format from F2 roadmaps

## Technical Details

### **Multi-Cloud Disaster Recovery**
- **Infrastructure**: Terraform modules for AKS and EKS deployment
- **Failover Automation**: Automated switching between cloud providers
- **Data Replication**: PostgreSQL streaming replication and MinIO site replication
- **Testing**: Automated failover drills and validation procedures
- **Recovery Procedures**: RTO < 15 minutes with zero data loss (RPO ≈ 0)

### **ISO27001 Compliance**
- **Stage 2 Audit**: External audit preparation and control implementation
- **Risk Assessment**: Comprehensive information security risk analysis
- **Control Framework**: Implementation of ISO27001 controls (A.8, A.9, A.10, A.14)
- **Audit Evidence**: Documentation and evidence collection procedures
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Ongoing compliance validation and improvement

### **Mobile React Native Suite**
- **Platform Coverage**: iOS and Android with feature parity
- **Offline Capabilities**: Complete offline functionality with background sync
- **Shell Mobile**: Main application with micro-frontend integration
- **iWMS Mobile**: RF terminal functionality with barcode scanning
- **Mercantiq Mobile**: POS and sales functionality
- **Security**: Mobile-specific security patterns and device management

## Dependencies
